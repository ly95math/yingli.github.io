I am currently a postdoctoral researcher at Harbin Institute of Technology, working under the guidance of Professor Chao Zhang(http://homepage-hit-edu-cn-s.ivpn.hit.edu.cn:1080/zhangchao). Before joining Harbin Institute of Technology, I completed my Ph.D. at Shanghai University under the guidance of Professor Fengping Yao(https://math.shu.edu.cn/info/1019/3040.htm). During my Ph.D. studies, I also had the opportunity to collaborate with Professor Iwona Chlebicka (https://www.mimuw.edu.pl/~ichlebicka/) as a joint Ph.D. student for one year.

My research interests primarily concern the existence and uniqueness of very weak solutions to elliptic and parabolic equations with non-standard growth, including entropy solutions and renormalized solutions. I am also currently investigating the regularity of solutions to such equations.
